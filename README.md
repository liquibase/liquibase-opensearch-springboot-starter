# Liquibase Extension for OpenSearch: Spring Boot Starter

This is the [Spring Boot] starter for [liquibase-opensearch], which allows you to easily use Liquibase with OpenSearch
clusters in Spring Boot.

Note that the standard [Liquibase Spring Boot integration] does *not* work with OpenSearch. You have to use this
integration here instead.

## Usage

This starter requires that an [`OpenSearchClient`][opensearch-java-client] is available as a bean. It is generally
recommended that you use [`spring-data-opensearch-starter`] to create this bean, however you can also provide your own.

Unlike `liquibase-opensearch` this will not attempt to create its own `OpenSearchClient` and consequently it does not
try to read any OpenSearch connection information from the properties.

Once you include this library as a dependency in your project it will automatically trigger the liquibase migration,
unless you set `opensearch.liquibase.enabled` to `false`.
By default, the integration will look for a changelog file at `db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml`.

Note that the standard Liquibase Spring integration will also be triggered automatically, thus you have to disable it
unless you have other databases besides OpenSearch for which you intend to use Liquibase as normally. To disable it
specify the following Spring configuration:
```yaml
spring.liquibase.enabled=false
```

See the [`liquibase-opensearch`] documentation for further details on the supported change types for OpenSearch.
